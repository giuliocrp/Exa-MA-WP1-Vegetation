= ExaMA - Vegetation

== Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that integrates trees into 3D urban models to improve the efficiency of thermal simulations. This project is part of the https://www.hidalgo2.eu[HiDALGO2] initiative, which aims to explore synergies between modeling, data acquisition, simulation, data analysis and visualization, with focus on improving building energy efficiency and indoor air quality.

== Installation and Usage

=== Required Packages

To build the project, you either need the following packages or you can use the provided Docker container:

- https://www.cgal.org/[CGAL] (master)
- https://cmake.org/[CMake] (>= 3.15)
- https://git-scm.com/[Git]
- https://www.boost.org/[Boost]
- https://fmt.dev/[fmt]
- https://www.mpfr.org/[MPFR]
- https://curl.se/[libcurl]

=== Installating package on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git libmpfr-dev libboost-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfmt-dev
```

=== Install CGAL
For our project, we need the master branch of CGAL:
```bash
git clone --branch master https://github.com/CGAL/cgal.git
mkdir cgal.build
cd cgal.build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to/cgal.install ../cgal
make install
```

=== Alternatively, using the Docker container:
This container can be used for developpement, when building the image the project is copied in the container without building the project.


You might want to remove the `build` directory before running (and closing) the container to avoid conflicts.

```bash
docker build -t 2024m1vegetation:latest .
docker run -it 2024m1vegetation:latest
```

On VsCode you can use the Remote - Containers extension to reopen the project in a container.

=== Build the Project
Configure and build the project using CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/workspace/cgal/cgal.install ..
make

# Run the tests
ctest
```

Note : this is the path used in the Docker container, you might need to change it to your own path.

=== Usage

Use the configuration file `config.json` to specify:

- `bbox`: The bounding box of the area of interest ("bottom latitude, bottom longitude, top latitude, top longitude")

- `origin`: The origin used in the conversion from latitude and longitude to Cartesian coordinates

- `LOD`: The level of detail (0, 1, 2, 3) of the meshes

- `altitude`: The altitube of the area of interest (in meters)

- `default_height_range`: The default height of the trees (in meters) when the height is not available in the OpenStreetMap data

- `default_genus`: The default genus of the trees when the genus is not available in the OpenStreetMap data

- `input_building_mesh`: The input building mesh file for merging the buildings with the trees

- `merge_builtings_trees`: Boolean to merge the trees with the buildings or not

- `output_file`: The base name of the output file saved in the `/output` directory

Use the `genus.json` file to specify the genus and height of the trees to be used in the simulation.

- `known_genus`: A list of genera for which we have a base mesh
- `cedrus_like`: A list of the genera for which the cedrus mesh model will be used
- etc.

To mesh your own tree model using link:https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Alpha_wrap_3/index.html[CGAL Alpha Wrapper] run:

```bash
./build/wrap Genus.stl <alpha> <offset>
```

Move the result to the `tree_ref` directory and add the genus to the `known_genus` in the `trees.json` file.

Finnaly run the program:
```bash
./build/src/run
```

The output mesh and some metrics will be saved in the `/output` directory (which is automatically created if needed).

You can visualize the output mesh with **Meshlab**, **Paraview** or any other mesh viewer.
